Occasionally, you will see this flag flying from senior citizens’ homes, or else from post offices:</p><p>The states generally get on well, and hardly ever fight outright. The state of Essoo has been ostracized many times, but that seems to have been politically motivated more than anything. For the casual visitor to Del Daurin Greater, each of the states offers unique experiences, vibrant cultures, and unforgettable surprises. You can visit the yawning chambers of the National Governing Building in Para, dig in the sand dunes in Mosz, or buy a variety of colorful shirts in Novice Coast.

There are many levels of government, from the national arena down to the neighborhoods. They behave how you might expect.</p><h2>History</h2><p>Prior to 1784, Del Daurin was composed of regions either ruled by kings (or emperors or whatnot) or else wilderlands where there wasn’t any incorporation. The area known as Paragon Valley began to incorporate into one large state with cities in the 1770s. This worked out well for them, and the land to the west, which was at that time two large kingdoms known as Ephlong and Pongo became interested in the wealth that was being generated in the Paragon Valley. After talks and skirmishes, the kingdom of Pongo joined the Paragon Valley and became the nation of Para-Pongo. This was in 1784.</p><p>In 1792, the island nation of <a href=\"{{ link:90bf455a-00d2-4911-bef1-17f797c7e5f7 }}\">Novice Coast</a>, as well as the original Ephlong region joined the nation of Para-Pongo, which was renamed Western Del Daurin. At this time, Western Del Daurin was composed of four states, Paragon Valley, Pongo, Ephlong and Novice Coast. The states of Ephlong and Pongo officially joined to form one state in 1823, largely because people had difficulty telling them apart anyhow.</p><p>In 1835, the sparsely populated area known as Mosz in southern Del Daurin was annexed into Western Del Daurin, which was renamed Del Daurin Greater (though not officially). The same thing happened in eastern Del Daurin with the region known as Essoo in 1859. This proved to be problematic because that is a wild land with lots of issues. They were stripped of statehood in 1863.</p><p>In 1885, the large swathe of land north of Mosz that at one time contained the ancient civilization of <a href=\"{{ link:e135d8ec-1f86-4f4d-a42e-ae5a29861c49 }}\">Vaz Chapa</a> was inducted as a state, along with Essoo again, as a goodwill gesture. This became the state of Wonderful Land. Prior to this time, it was believed that there were still those who considered themselves to be Vaz Chapas, and they would not agree to joining Del Daurin Greater. After a while, nobody claimed this anymore because it was too hard to live in the desert when there were nice cities to the south and north.</p><p>In 1903, Del Daurin Greater attempted to annex the remaining continental region known as <a href=\"{{ link:97cbcb3e-2a24-404f-8b95-9a46d7f18e1e }}\">Terratar</a> into the nation. The inhabitants of Terratar rejected this notion, though not collectively, as they were not a collective. From 1910 until 1916, there was a war with Terratar for not paying taxes, abiding by national laws, and basically just ignoring Del Daurin Greater. A treaty was signed in 1916 allowing them to remain unincorporated territory. In 1950, there was a large athletic event held in Terratar as a sign of goodwill. It was called the Good Neighbor Games. It was sparsely attended.</p>"

His wealth was procured by a variety of means. He headed the most prolific cereal operation in Adobega County and was rumored to be involved with dubious import and export of wildlife and automobiles. Due to his wealth and status, he must take precautions when traveling day to day. To this end, he utilizes a fleet of dummy autos and custom-made body doubles. These groups leave his estate at hour intervals every day, and travel to various locations in a complicated and ever changing pattern.

He often attends the public viewings in the city center to obtain ideas for new endeavors. It was from one of these observational periods that he developed the idea for <a href=\"{{ link:cc2495a6-39c1-4793-aec2-a5ec3081350a }}\">Cereal Hounds</a>.</p><h2>History</h2><p>Mr. Capestrano is known to have negotiated a deal for the purchase of what is now known as Mr. Capestrano's Mountain from <a href=\"{{ link:19f9bb44-f12d-406d-a8f8-556e3bd0da07 }}\">King James</a>. This deal, which was rumored to have occurred in 1951, is the first recorded incidence of Mr. Capestrano in Adobe Skyscraper, though many current historians believe that he has lived in Adobe Skyscraper his entire life. Other than the nature of some of his businesses, and the identities of some of his supposed associates, very little is known about Mr. Capestrano. For example, no one knows his first name. Although many low quality recordings exists of his underlings pleading with him to be reasonable and understanding, they always refer to him simply as, “please, Mr. Capestrano.”</p><p>After establishing himself as a cereal mogul, Mr. Capestrano began inviting various groups of people to his estate in order to observe them and obtain news ideas for entrepreneurial endeavors. The ideas he received as part of these exercises, in addition to the ideas he took from Grade Scholastic Techno-Science Fairs became his main source of revenue after the passing of the Cereal Restriction Act. It is unknown how many of the affairs of the city are actually endeavors of Mr. Capestrano, but the estimates range from 30 to 84%, including some schools and research parks.</p>"

It is a popular afternoon beverage that is initially consumed at a high temperature (around 50°C) but very rapidly decreases to a sub-freezing temperature (around -3°C). This curious plunge in temperature is due to the interaction of the blueberries with the stringent acid of the Badminton Tree leaves. For a typical serving (around 2 cups) this temperature swing occurs over about twenty seconds. It is the combination of this riveting swoop in temperature and the natural stimulants of the ingredients that makes the beverage so popular for mid-afternoon workers.</p>"

This is because the rent in the Adobe Skyscraper is very low compared to office retail in, say, <a href=\"{{ link:dde90431-b9ef-498b-b2d8-5d97a1886609 }}\">Hampton Park</a> or the <a href=\"{{ link:9f3e63fc-e81b-4eb1-8796-1e940d1a2109 }}\">Lamplake District</a>. Those who qualify as an executive or a <a href=\"{{ link:d9829f4c-c2c7-47ce-9340-0e4d520daf85 }}\">microexecutive</a> have access to the exclusive <a href=\"{{ link:1e76f518-4485-4b4d-b276-5079a95e402c }}\">Captain's Club</a>. This perk has drawn more than one business to the Adobe Skyscraper, even at the cost of foot traffic. Being able to visit the Captain's Club once a day at 2:45 for <a href=\"{{ link:d21860f6-4f6e-49c5-b789-5241813379ba }}\">raquettea</a> and bagels is worth having one's business on the 49th floor and somewhat out of people's way. In fact, the Adobe Skyscraper is itself such a draw that many people will visit simply to ride the glass elevator and wind up shopping at one of the businesses located therein.</p>"

Most of that negativity has subsided since then, probably since the Good Neighbor Games were a dismal failure and generally considered a terrible idea in hindsight, but that’s a story for another time. Right now, the story is the great state of Wonderful Land; 5th (or 6th) state to join the nation of <a href=\"{{ link:dc7de195-c92c-47ee-a9d0-891b64bac5d3 }}\">Del Daurin</a> Greater, a land rich with history, geography, people, and monorails.</p><p>Before Wonderful Land agreed to statehood as a part of Del Daurin Greater, it was a dynamic interchange of private kingdoms, land ownership cooperatives, and wilderness persons. This region was probably best known as the cradle (and grave) of the <a href=\"{{ link:e135d8ec-1f86-4f4d-a42e-ae5a29861c49 }}\">Vaz Chapa</a> civilization, which dwelled in the <a href=\"{{ link:4594b182-2faa-42ed-89e8-3b77db887772 }}\">Modal Desert</a> that covers the majority of the state. The Vaz Chapa are widely believed to be the oldest civilization on Del Daurin, but they died out thousands of years ago. These days, all that is left of them is their gigantic trapezoidal tombs and the creature (or device?) that built them.</p><p>Wonderful Land officially became a state of Del Daurin on April 10, 1956. The state name was decided by popular vote, narrowly beating out Modem State. (Coincidently, there is now a university west of the city of <a href=\"{{ link:e2efd9a8-737d-4901-9759-c6a2b0b6890f }}\">Librari</a> called Modem State. They have a strong industrial arts program.) The flag for the state of Wonderful Land looks like this:</p><p>It was designed by Mary Enziming, a 4th grade student in Adobe Skyscraper, as part of a state curriculum creativity assignment. Her explanation of the flag reads:</p><blockquote><p>The mountains stand for Multiple Mountain, which is special to the state. The star represents <a href=\"{{ link:f9db479f-2199-4bb1-9b10-3192dea730ce }}\">St. Tsonga Island</a>, which is large and important for learning and university. The blue represents the sea, the yellow represents the Modal Desert, and the green represents the living things like trees and people and other animals.</p></blockquote>"
